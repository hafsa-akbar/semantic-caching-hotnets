The background is a gradient of blue, transitioning from a lighter shade at the top to a darker shade at the bottom. The infographic is divided into four sections, each representing a different symptom of Alzheimer's.  In the first section, there is a woman with white hair wearing glasses. She is holding her hand to her forehead, and there are question marks around her head. This represents the symptom of forgetting recent conversations or events.  The second section shows the same woman, but this time she is holding a magnifying glass to her face. This symbolizes the symptom of losing belongings.  The third section features the woman again, but this time she is depicted with a thought bubble. Inside the bubble, there are two question marks, indicating the symptom of struggling to think of the right word.  The final section shows the woman with a question mark above her head, and she is holding a piece of paper with a question mark on it. This represents the symptom of forgetting names of places and objects.  Each section is labeled with a brief description of the symptom it represents. The overall design is simple and clear, making it easy to understand the information presented."
