(POLARIS PROGRAM / AFP),Mission Polaris Dawn de SpaceX: on the issue of the first private space flight of history four amateur astronauts return to Earth,"The image depicts four individuals inside what appears to be a small, enclosed space, possibly a vehicle or a confined area within a larger vehicle. The individuals are dressed in dark-colored wetsuits, suggesting they might be engaged in water-based activities or are in a wet environment. The wetsuits are designed to provide thermal insulation and buoyancy.  The person on the far left is waving with their right hand, while the other three are raising their left hands in a similar manner. This gesture could indicate a friendly greeting or a signal to someone outside the frame of the image.  The person in the center has a distinctive hairstyle with long, curly hair that is voluminous and appears to be styled upwards. The other three individuals have their hair styled in a more conventional manner, with the person on the far right having a hairstyle that is voluminous and wavy.  The interior of the space is not clearly visible, but there are some controls or instruments visible in the background, which might suggest that this is a specialized vehicle or a piece of equipment designed for a specific purpose. The lighting is bright, and the overall atmosphere seems to be one of camaraderie and enjoyment among the group."
image_5_1.jpg,The launch of a satellite in Iran on 5 November 2022. (SEPAH NEWS / AFP),"L'Iran launches ""with success"" a new research satellite","The image depicts a rocket launch, with the rocket ascending into the sky. The rocket is in the center of the frame, with its exhaust visible as a bright white trail against the backdrop of the sky. The sky is partly cloudy, with some clouds appearing to be illuminated by the sun, suggesting it might be early morning or late afternoon.  In the foreground, there are several flags on poles, arranged in a row. The flags are of various colors, including blue, green, red, and white, which are the national colors of several countries. This suggests that the launch might be a joint effort or a celebration of international cooperation.  The ground appears to be a flat, open area, likely a launch site, with no visible structures or buildings. The focus of the image is on the rocket and the flags, with the sky serving as a natural background that emphasizes the upward trajectory of the rocket. The image does not contain any text or additional elements that provide context or information about the specific launch or the location. The style of the image is a realistic photograph with a focus on the action of the rocket launch."
image_6_1.jpg,Since more than a half-century researchers have had suspicions about this global electric field finally measured at an altitude of more than 250 km. (NASA'S GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER),On a detected electric current planetary,"The image depicts a stylized representation of Earth, which is colored in shades of blue and illuminated by a bright light emanating from within it. The Earth is centered in the image and is surrounded by concentric circles that suggest the presence of magnetic or electromagnetic fields. These fields are represented by a series of curved lines that radiate outward from the Earth, creating a dynamic and somewhat abstract visual effect. The background is a dark blue, which contrasts with the lighter blue of the Earth and the white and light blue of the fields, enhancing the overall visual impact of the image. The style of the image is digital art, with a focus on the interplay between the Earth and the surrounding energy patterns."

The suit is designed with a large, rounded helmet that covers the entire head, and it has a white torso with blue stripes running vertically down the center. The suit also includes a white waist belt with a blue buckle. The background is a plain white wall with a clock mounted on it, indicating the setting might be an office or a laboratory. The overall scene suggests a professional environment, possibly related to space exploration or research."
image_10_1.jpg,Space: launch of the private mission Polaris Dawn with a SpaceX spacecraft,Space: launch of the private mission Polaris Dawn with a SpaceX spacecraft,"The image depicts a nighttime scene at a space launch facility. The central focus is a rocket booster, which is emitting a bright, fiery exhaust as it ascends into the sky. The booster is attached to a tall, cylindrical structure that appears to be a launch tower, with various stages of the rocket visible against the dark sky. The launch tower is illuminated by the light of the rocket's ascent, creating a dramatic contrast with the surrounding darkness.  In the foreground, there are several smaller structures that could be part of the launch facility's infrastructure, including what might be control towers or service buildings. The ground is covered in a mix of grass and gravel, typical of an industrial site. The sky is dark, suggesting that the photo was taken during the late evening or night, which is a common time for rocket launches due to the lower atmospheric temperatures and reduced air traffic.  The image captures the intense energy of a rocket launch, with the bright light of the exhaust and the towering structure of the launch tower dominating the scene. The composition of the image, with the rocket in the center and the launch tower to the left, creates a sense of motion and direction, as if the viewer is looking up towards the sky where the rocket is ascending."
