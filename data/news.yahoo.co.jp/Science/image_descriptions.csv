image_1_1.jpg,,"The interaction galaxy ""ARP 107"" observed by the clashed galaxy and the elliptical galaxy Webb space telescope","The image you've provided appears to be a photograph of a celestial scene, likely taken with a telescope equipped with a camera that can capture images of deep space. The scene is dominated by a large, bright object in the center, which is a galaxy. This galaxy is characterized by a prominent ring of stars and dust, a common feature known as a galactic ring. The colors within the galaxy are a mix of red, orange, and pink hues, which are indicative of various types of stars and nebulous regions.  Surrounding the galaxy are numerous smaller objects, which are likely other galaxies or galaxy clusters, given their similar appearance and the vastness of the space they occupy. These objects are scattered throughout the image, some closer to the viewer and others further away, creating a sense of depth and scale.  The background is a deep black, which is typical for images of deep space, as it represents the vast emptiness of the cosmos. The stars and other celestial bodies are visible as tiny points of light against this dark backdrop, emphasizing the vastness of the universe and the isolation of the galaxy in the center.  Overall, the image captures a moment in the life of a galaxy, surrounded by the remnants of other galaxies and stars, a testament to the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the universe.",https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/49d2b3706b67e21782b57b39cf8fdace70013399

image_8_1.jpg,,"The spiral galaxy IC 1954"" in which the Hubble Space Telescope was photographed “and Keisces ”""","The image you've provided appears to be a photograph of a galaxy, captured in the infrared spectrum. This type of image is often taken by telescopes equipped with infrared cameras, which can penetrate the dust and gas that obscures our view of distant galaxies in visible light. The galaxy is a spiral galaxy, characterized by its distinct spiral arms and a bright central core, which is likely the supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy.  The colors in the image are a result of the different wavelengths of light detected by the infrared camera. The warm colors, such as reds and oranges, indicate the presence of hydrogen and helium, which are the most abundant elements in the universe. The cooler colors, such as blues and greens, are likely due to the presence of carbon and other elements that are less abundant.  The image is a composite, with various elements of the galaxy highlighted in different colors to emphasize different features. The bright central core is often the most prominent feature, as it is the densest region of the galaxy, with the highest concentration of stars and other celestial objects. The spiral arms are regions of star formation, where new stars are being born from the interstellar gas and dust.  The image also contains various stars and other celestial objects, including smaller galaxies, star clusters, and nebulae. These objects are scattered throughout the galaxy, some closer to the viewer and others further away, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image.
