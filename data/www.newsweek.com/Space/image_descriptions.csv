image_7_1.jpg,sun filament and aurora,Auroras Forecast Over US After Sun Expels 'Dark Plasma' at Earth,"The image depicts a solar phenomenon known as the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. The aurora is a natural light display that typically occurs in the polar regions. The aurora is shown in a circular inset within the larger image of the sun. The aurora itself is a mix of green and red colors, which are produced by the interaction of electrically charged particles in the Earth's atmosphere. The sun in the background is shown with its surface, which is a bright yellow-orange color, and the solar corona, which is a darker, more diffuse region surrounding the sun. The solar corona is a region of the sun's atmosphere where the temperature drops significantly, and it is the source of the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that flows away from the sun. The solar wind is thought to be responsible for the aurora, as it interacts with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere."
