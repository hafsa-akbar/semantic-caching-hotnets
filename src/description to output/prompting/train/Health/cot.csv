**Theme or Subject Matter:**
The primary topic of Image A is a substance (caffeine powder) related to a health risk (overdose death), while Image B depicts a coffee-making process related to a health benefit (lower risk of heart and metabolic disease). Although both images are related to caffeine, the thematic differences are significant, and the focus is on different aspects of caffeine consumption.

**Visual Style and Composition:**
The visual styles of the two images differ. Image A has a more clinical and precise composition, focusing on the powder and the spoon, while Image B has a more inviting and warm composition, focusing on the coffee and the mug. The framing and perspective are not comparable.
